### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Throughout all my years of dedication, commitment, and hard work, my focus has been to excel. I set high expectations and goals for myself and, having reached them, accumulated invaluable managerial experience. As an IT engineer, I participated in a variety of projects and created new products and services, always aiming not just to satisfy but anticipate clientsâ€™ every need.

As the CEO of Studio 5, I have spent the last ten years growing my company into one of the biggest advertising companies in North Macedonia, which now boasts highly skilled teams and production lines. 

Now, I am looking for new challenges and opportunities within a multinational company. My focus is to improve my development skills and cross through all development processes starting from the frontend, backend, and databases.
